# CheddaBoards ðŸ§€

Open source SDK for decentralized game leaderboards and achievements on the Internet Computer Protocol.

## What is CheddaBoards?

CheddaBoards provides a **free hosted backend service** for indie game developers to add leaderboards, achievements, and player profiles to their games. Your data is stored permanently on the ICP blockchain.

- **Free Tier**: Up to 1000 players per game
- **Open Source SDK**: This repository
- **Hosted Backend**: We handle the infrastructure
- **No Vendor Lock-in**: Export your data anytime

## Features

- **Multi-Auth Support**: Google, Apple, Internet Identity, and anonymous logins
- **Cross-Platform**: Works in browsers, Unity, Godot, and any JavaScript environment
- **Blockchain Permanent**: Data stored on ICP blockchain
- **Simple Integration**: One-line initialization
- **Rich Analytics**: Track player behavior and engagement
- **Achievement System**: Unlock and track achievements
- **Real-time Leaderboards**: Global and filtered rankings

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
npm install @cheddaboards/sdk
```

Or include directly in HTML:
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@cheddaboards/sdk/dist/cheddaboards.min.js"></script>
```

### Basic Usage

```javascript
import CheddaBoards from '@cheddaboards/sdk';

// Initialize with your game ID (uses hosted service)
const chedda = await CheddaBoards.init(null, {
  gameId: 'my-awesome-game',  // Required: Your unique game ID
  gameName: 'My Awesome Game',
  gameDescription: 'The best game ever made'
});

// Login options
await chedda.login.anonymous('Player123');
// or with Google (requires your own Google OAuth setup)
await chedda.login.google(googleCredential, 'PlayerNickname');
// or with Internet Identity (no setup required!)
await chedda.login.ii('PlayerNickname');

// Submit a score
await chedda.submitScore(1500, 10); // score, streak

// Get leaderboard
const leaders = await chedda.getLeaderboard('score', 10);

// Unlock achievement
await chedda.unlockAchievement(
  'first_win',
  'First Victory',
  'Win your first game'
);
```

## How It Works

```
Your Game â†’ CheddaBoards SDK â†’ Hosted ICP Backend â†’ Blockchain Storage
```

1. **You integrate** the SDK into your game
2. **We provide** the backend infrastructure (free up to limits)
3. **ICP blockchain** ensures permanent data storage
4. **Players** get unified profiles across all CheddaBoards games

## Authentication Methods

### Anonymous Login
Perfect for casual play without requiring sign-up:
```javascript
await chedda.login.anonymous('GuestPlayer');
```

### Internet Identity (Recommended)
Blockchain-native auth, no configuration needed:
```javascript
await chedda.login.ii('PlayerNickname');
```

### Google Sign-In
Requires your own Google OAuth credentials:
```javascript
// After Google OAuth flow with YOUR credentials
await chedda.login.google(googleIdToken, 'PlayerNickname');
```

### Apple Sign-In
Requires your own Apple Developer account:
```javascript
// After Apple OAuth flow with YOUR credentials
await chedda.login.apple(appleResponse, 'PlayerNickname');
```
